## Definition

A Workspace is a collaborative, all-encompassing dashboard for you & your team to work together to make your Applications, Enterprise Ready. When you first signup for ScaleKit, we create a Workspace for you. You can then configure your Applications and invite your Team Members to collaborate in this Workspace. 

In other words, a Workspace acts like a bounded entity within which your Applications, and the Applications' Envrionments, Team Members and the associated roles & privilege management are configured. 

At the time of signup, we create a workspace ID that uniquely represents your workspace within ScaleKit World. You are only required to use this Workspace ID to manage your Workspace configuration programmatically via ScaleKit APIs.

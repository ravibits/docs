## Definition
Application refers to the web application or mobile application that needs to be Enterprise Ready. Example: Slack

You could be building one or more applications that you are building and selling. For each of the applications that you want to make them enterprise ready, you are required to create an `Application` entity in your `Workspace`.

## Relationship with Workspace
Any Application is created and managed within the context of a Workspace and as such can belong to only one Workspace. But, a Workspace can have one or more Applications.
